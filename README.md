# Control (Control System)
-------------------
ALL ABOUT CONTROL
* **[Control Tutorials](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&section=SystemModeling)**(UM control tutorials, GO BLUE!)<br>
* **Nonlinear**(Please look into this [website](https://mae.ufl.edu/research/matrix/dsc/), I basically learnt all my Nonlinear skill set from Prof. Warren Dixon in University of Florida:crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile:)<br>
The nonlinear course taught by Prof. Warren Dixon is amazing, but it also require a lot of effort. There are some courses taught by his student [TengHu Cheng](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtOUtRZXxUOBWeLF_cT8r-Q/videos) on youtube.It's very worth watching too.
* **[MATLAB ODE Playground](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/solving-odes-in-matlab/euler-ode1/)**
* **[Control Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw/playlists)**
* **[Linear Algebra and Differential Equations](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/dela/)**(Courses taught by Prof. Gilbert Strang, basically those course videos are the best resources for us learning Linear Algebra. Also, Matlab Founder, Cleve Moler taught you how to use ODE Suite [here](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/learn-differential-equations.html).)
