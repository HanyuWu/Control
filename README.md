ALL ABOUT CONTROL
* **[Linear](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&section=SystemModeling)**
* **Nonlinear**(Please look into this [website](https://mae.ufl.edu/research/matrix/dsc/), I basically learnt all my Nonlinear skill set from Prof. Warren Dixon in University of Florida:crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile::crocodile:)<br>
The nonlinear course taught by Prof. Warren Dixon is amazing, but it also require a lot of effort. There are some courses taught by his student [TengHu Cheng](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtOUtRZXxUOBWeLF_cT8r-Q/videos) on youtube.It's very worth watching too.
